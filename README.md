# VIDEO WALKTHROUGH OF <br /> `COMMAND LINE CRUD APPLICATION` LESSON

These videos correlate with the [Command Line CRUD Application](https://github.com/10-3-pursuit/unit-front-end-web-development/tree/main/command-line-crud-application) Lesson.
Each video takes a chunk of the codealong and explains what to do. This will allow you to refer back to specific sections that you may want to revisit for debugging and/or understanding.

The same techniques will apply to building your command line project.
